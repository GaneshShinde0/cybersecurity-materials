WebSocket

	Okay, imagine you have two tin cans and a string between them. When you talk into one can, the sound travels through the string to the other can, and your friend can hear you. That's like how a regular website works. You send a message, and the server sends a response back.

	Now, imagine if you and your friend had a magic string that not only carried your words but stayed connected all the time. So, instead of connecting and disconnecting every time you want to talk, you can just talk whenever you want, and your friend can reply right away. That's a bit like how Websockets work on the internet.

	Websockets are like a special kind of string that keeps the connection open, so you can send messages back and forth really quickly, without having to set up a new connection each time. It's like having a super fast and always open line of communication between your browser and a server on the internet. That's helpful for things like online games or live chats on websites, where you want to talk back and forth without any delays.


This online shop has a live chat feature implemented using WebSockets.

Chat messages that you submit are viewed by a support agent in real time.

To solve the lab, use a WebSocket message to trigger an alert() popup in the support agent's browser.

	Click "Live chat" and send a chat message.
	In Burp Proxy, go to the WebSockets history tab, and observe that the chat message has been sent via a WebSocket message.
	Using the browser, send a new message containing a < character.
	In Burp Proxy, find the corresponding WebSocket message and observe that the < has been HTML-encoded by the client before sending.
	Ensure that Burp Proxy is configured to intercept WebSocket messages, then send another chat message.
	Edit the intercepted message to contain the following payload:

	<img src=1 onerror='alert(1)'>
	Observe that an alert is triggered in the browser. This will also happen in the support agent's browser.
